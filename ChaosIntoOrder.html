                    Most things in the workfield are in Chaos. It is our responsibility to design and create healthy,
                    robust and maintainable products. When we have products that are properly monitored its uptime will
                    increase and you will have more confidence in your product.

                <p>These five steps seem simple and logical. They are logical. The problem is this is an ongoing
                    process. You won't know what breaks until it has broken. You won't know what caused the break until
                    it breaks and most likely until it breaks multiple times.
                    <img src="Pics/measurmentTape.jpg" class="card-img">
                    Once you know why something is breaking then you can write something to help you detect that it is
                    broken. After knowing what is broken and why it's broken you can then work on making a prediction
                    when it will break. It is at this point that you can now go strengthen what is causing the break to
                    occur.
                    One of the scary things about this process is when the problem is not your code. It is said that 99%
                    percent of the code you will interact with will not be your own. This could be any third party
                    program working on someone else's hardware, or maybe an API you call to work with. Just because what
                    most of the code you work with is not your own does not mean that you can't check and strengthen the
                    information given to you.

                    Overall if you want your application to be robust and healthy you need to implement Telemetry.
                    Without these measurements you will not know when you are having a problem unless you are actively
                    watching your program. For me a little extra work of reporting is worth being able to sleep better
                    at night.
