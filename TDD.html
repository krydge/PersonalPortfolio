            What is TDD
            TDD ruleset
            No production code without a failing test
            No test is more than what will cause it to fail
            No more production code than is needed to pass the test
            Why Use TDD
                TDD leads to flexible code. This means that the code base can be changed without fear of destroying your program. 
            It allows people to experiment and try new things without affecting everything else created.
            It shows you where something has broken and helps you figure out where to fix the problem.
            It can help you be confident in your code working as expected.
            Fast example of TDD.

            Extra use of TDD
            It helps you understand existing code or purchased code.
            To learn a codebase, write tests to figure out how the code works. Keep this around so that if the code is changed you can know if it will break your code when you run the tests.
