            <h1>Agile</h1>
            <h2>What is Agile?</h2>
            <p>Agile is a common process used to get projects complete. It is based on the agile manifestio which can be
                found here at the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">Manifesto</a>. The Idea is that we focus on
                creating good
                software over the processes to get the software. The name Agile describes the goal of being able to make
                the cahnges needed.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
            </h3>
            <p>
                This is saying that people are more imporatant than the rules we set in place. This is to promote
                experimenting and a willingness to try new ways. It is when we experiment that we find better ways
                accomplish the project.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Working software over comprehensive documentation
            </h3>
            <p>
                The goal of Agile is to have working software. This means get software working before we document how
                and why it works. It also means that you can start working on the software early. WE dont need to wait
                to have eery single detail planned out before work can begin.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
            </h3>
            <p>
                This is about making the project the customer wants and needs not just what they agreed and thought they
                wanted at the begining. Often customers do not know what they need or want. This idea promotes
                communication and a working relationship between the customer and those doing the work. With this
                constant communication the product ends up where the customer wants and not what they thought they
                wanted.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Responding to change over following a plan
            </h3>
            <p>
                This is again the same idea of flexibility or being AGILE. Be willing to make changes, dont feel that
                Stuck by the initial thoughts about the project. Be daring.
            </p>
            <h3>
                How do you do you live Agile?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Currently I am working on an open source project called project aspen. It is to help charities with
                fundraising. I am one of three scrum leaders for the project. Each working day we as a team have a Daily
                stand up. THis is where our small team of 4 meets and shares struggles, success and our new tasks with
                each other for the coming working time. I then once a week have a meeting discussing what we as a team
                are doing, I get to ask questions for help or what needs to be done to direct my team. It is these fast
                and often meetings where we learn waht is being doen and what else needs to be done. We get to see the
                successes of the other teams and the pitfalls. We are communicating. WE also have been meeting with one
                of the charities useing the Site on what they liek what they want and how it can be imporved. Each time
                we meet with the customer we get feedbackon how we are doing and how the project is meeting its
                responsibilities. I believe the main benifit of the Agile method is its quick feedback. This feedback is
                why you end up with a good project and not just the agreed upon project.
