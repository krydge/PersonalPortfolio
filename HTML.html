            <h1>My entire website has been pure HTML and CSS</h1>
            <p>I took the opertunity to only use basic html and css for this website. I did this because this is the
                foundation for a view on the web. All of the other frameworks require an understanding of HTML and CSS.
            </p>
            <p>I have used a html template that I created so that each page has the same view and design. THe thing I
                have learned from this experiment is that organization of files is important. Many frameworks promote a
                file style that can speed up the process. When you do it from scratch as the project grows it can get
                alittle out of hand. I need to refactor this project to make it cleaner and easier to add things to the
                project.</p>
