                <p>I wrote a simple Api that wraps another Api. (The Chuck Norris Joke Api)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="story">
                <p>In the World of programming communication between software is always something to consider.
                    The way we accomplish this is by using API.
                    Application Programming Interface.
                    This is the way that a program or part of a program has agreed to receive requests for Data and the
                    way
                    they will return the requested Data. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="explain">
                <p>We have seen many different types of API’s designs. The ones I have most often seen are REST, and
                    RPC.
                    Each has their own standards and definitions as to what makes them work.

                    I use REST for most of my work. This is nice because it allows me to rely on HTTP.
                    Most of the time it uses GET and POST Requests.

                <p>I have made a simple API that wraps another API “ The Chuck Norris Joke API” to return a random joke
                </p>
                <img src="Pics\ReturnedJokeFromApi.PNG">
                <p>I used the Template from Visual Studio to scaffold out an ASP.net API. This gives us a working
                    API to gather weather data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I then changed the existing code to create a http client.
                </p>
                <img src="Pics\GetJoke.PNG">
                <p>
                    I set the base url to call the existing API format.
                </p>
                <p>I then added any special requirements to the url.</p>
                <p>I make the call to the other API.</p>
                <p>This Api returns the data as json.</p>
                <p>I have to parse this data and store it in an object.</p>
                <p>I then format the Data I received and return it back with just the joke to the user.</p>
