                <h1>React the Framework</h1>
                <p>For my work I use the vue framweork. It is similar to React. When I started My current position I was
                    told they wanted me to use react. I was excited because this is something I had wanted to learn.
                    Then on my first day I was told guess what change of plans we are using vue.js. This meant I had to
                    learn a different framework than I had done some preping for so I dove into it.</p>

                <p>This is one of the things they wanted me to change into a vue app. Sadly I cant show you what it was
                    turned into because it's an internal tool for the IT department. </p>
