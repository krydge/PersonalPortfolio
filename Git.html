            Git Tutorial:
            Git is a source code version control system.
            Now what does this mean? Git is a way to manage source code for individuals and groups. It lets you know
            about every change that has been made to the code you are working on with notes (if you choose to add them)
            about the code.

            Why should You use Git?
            Have you thought of the problem of making a change to your code and needing to go back to what you have.
            What about wanting to try something that you don't know will work. What if you are working with a group of
            people with each person making changes to the code. What are you going to do to make this less painful?
            Git tracks all of the pushed changes to your code. This means that if you decide you don't like the code you
            wrote you can go back to anytime you committed the code. This helps remove the fear of making changes to
            your code.
            I remember when I first started coding. I didn't know about git at all. So my solution to this was that I
            made a new copy of my code then worked only on this copy for the day. I did this and saved all the files
            onto a thumb drive.The problem I had was that I would forget what version I was on or what changes were
            made. I also couldn't work with others on any of these projects at the same time.
            Now can you imagine trying to work with another person using this system I came up with. Only one of us
            would be able to work at a time. Then when you get control again i wouldn't know what changes were made.
            What if we both made a copy then worked on those copies at the same time. How would we put the two copies
            together?
            The solution to all these problems I pointed out is to use git.
            Who uses git?
            Git is the de facto source control for most businesses and individuals who work with code. This means that
            if you know git you can work with almost anyone else because they will probably use git for their version
            control.
            I use Git for my personal projects for class projects and for working with others.
            How do You use git?
            The main things you need to know about to use git are the commands: git clone, git pull, git push, git add
            ,git checkout, git branch,and git merge. As you use git you will learn a few other commands but this set of
            7 will do almost everything
            git clone:
            This is the command to copy a different repo

            git pull:
            Git pull tells git to get you the most recent code to work on. It is a good idea to do this before you start
            working on any code. It will make sure that you have the most up to date code.

            git add .:
            This is the command to tell git to remember all of the changes you have made up to this point. The command
            is read as git add all.

            git commit -m “message “:
            This is the command to say make commit with all of the changes that i have made. It saves all the changes.
            The message portion is something you add that lets you add notes or comments about the

            git push:
            This tells git that you want to store the commit someplace other than on your computer. Often you will push
            to github which is an online repository.

            git branch “branchname”:
            This is the command to make a new copy of the code that can be worked on separated from the main code that
            everyone else will use. The branch name is something you give when you create the branch. The main branch is
            normally called master.

            git checkout “ branch name”:
            This is the command to work on an existing branch. So if you have been working on branch api and want to
            work on branch logic this is the command to use.

            git merge “branch” “branch”
            This is the command to put your branches changes with other branches changes. The two branches are merged
            together into one. This can be hard when working with others. It is a good idea to merge often into main or
            master.

            All of these commands are used in the terminal. There are gui’s for using git but I personally mostly use
            the Terminal.

            Concerns about using git.
            Git is hard for many people to learn to use. It is robust with many more things than what I showed how to
            use.
