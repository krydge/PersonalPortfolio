                <h2>What Is Kotlin</h2>
                <p>Recently I Needed to learn the language Kotlin. I had never used it or understood what the benifits
                    for
                    it were. So over the weekend I started to introduce myself to it.</p>
                <p>Kotlin is a language similar to Java. It runs on the JVM. It was made to fix some of the problems
                    found
                    with Java.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h2 class="card-title">The Differences</h2>
                <p class="card-body">Kotlin uses val and var.
                    <img src="Pics/kotlinVal.PNG" />
                    Val is imutible. Its similar to making
                    something const in other languages.
                    <img src="Pics/kotlinVar.PNG" />
                    Var is
                    mutable. Its like most other variables. Kotlin will infer the datatype so you dont have to explisity
                    state the data type. Somthing I found to be interesting about Kotlin is that it wont automaticaly
                    convert datatypes. You alwasy have to declare how it is to be changed.

                <h2>The Tomato Project</h2>
                <p>I decided to write a pomodoro app using kotlin.
                    The initial set up is very simple. I used IntelliJ IDEA. This is who created kotlin.
                </p>
                <img src="Pics/kotlinMainfun.PNG" />
                <p>
                    I then created a main function that is the entry point of the app.
                </p>
                <img src="Pics/kotlinWorkerFunctions.PNG" />
                <p>
                    I then created the Work timer function this is what keeps track of passed time and time remaining in
                    the
                    round.
                    I then created the break Timer function. It is nearly the same as the Work Timer. If I had more time
                    I
                    would refactor both into a single function that does different things based on the state of the app.

                <p>
                    I then wrote some helper functions to check what round we are in, convert the time given and
                    returned to
                    the user and made a simple menu for the user to interact with.

            <h2>What I would do different</h2>
            <p>This project was to help introduce me to the Kotlin Language. If I was to redo this project I would use
                oop. I would break things down further into smaller parts. I would also like to work on a gui for the
                app.
                I think it would be nice tohave it make sounds to alert the user of what state it is going into.
