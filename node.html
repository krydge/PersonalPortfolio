            I was hired to work on changing apps from php to node.js with react front ends. 
            I did not know php, react or node.js. 
            I had some knowledge of javascript.
            Before my first day I started following tutorials on react and node.js.
            My first day at work they told me they decided to use Vue instead of react.
            So I spent a day learning Vue and understanding the framework. I think it is simple.
            I used this site as a resource to learn Vue. https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html
            I made some test vue apps to practice using vue.
            I then started working on the actual project. It was already a framework but we found that it was not planned very well.
