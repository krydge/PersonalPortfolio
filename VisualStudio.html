                    What Is Visual Studio?

                <div class="card-body">
                    Visual Studio is an IDE developed by Microsoft. An IDE is an integrated Development Environment.
                    This is
                    a
                    tool that tries to give developers all of the tools they need in one place. This is normally helpful
                    to
                    make
                    development fast.

                    What Is It Used For?
                </h1>
                <div class="card-body">
                    An IDE is meant to help developers be more productive. The hope is that by having everything local
                    they
                    will
                    be able to do the work faster. I think we can think of VIsual Studio as a woodworking toolbox. You
                    fill
                    the
                    toolbox with the most common and likely tools that you will need to complete the project you are
                    working
                    on.
                    This helps prevent you from needing to run around and find the specific tool because you already
                    know
                    where
                    the tool will be at. The problem may arise where the tool is not in your toolbox and you need to go
                    find
                    it.
                    This slows you down but now you can add that tool to the toolbox so that you don't need to go find
                    it
                    again.
                    Modern Visual studio is like this toolbox. It has what you hope are all the tools that you will need
                    and
                    most of the time it seems to have all of them. Sometimes you will have to find a new tool and with
                    the
                    architecture of visual studio you can often add that tool to Visual Studio.
                    Something more that Visual Studio allows is that it can do a lot of scaffolding for the developer.
                    This
                    means that if I want to make a web app visual studio will give me the needed startup code to get an
                    app
                    up
                    and running. This can save tons of time but don't expect the generated code to be what you will end
                    up
                    with.
                    You still need to make changes to it to fit your needs.

                    Why Should I Use It?
                </h1>
                <div class="card-body">
                    So Why use Visual Studio? It has most of the things you as the developer will need. Another reason
                    is
                    that
                    it is supported by Microsoft. This means that they are keeping it up to date. They are adding new
                    features
                    and it is available with a free version.
                    What Are some of the ways to use it/ techniques?
                    So the first thing you need to do is download Visual Studios. To do this go to
                    https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
                    And download the community version.
                    <div>
                    <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="Pics\Vs download.PNG"/>
                </div>
                    This will take some time and some space because it is a large program because it tries to have
                    everything.
                    Once it is downloaded run Visual Studio and you will be given the option to create a new project. We
                    will
                    create a new project.
                    <div>
                    <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="Pics\vsprojectselect.PNG"/>
                </div>
                    Give the project a name. We will give ours as the name demoApp.
                    <div>
                    <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="Pics\vsDemoApp.PNG"/>
                </div>
                    We then get to choose a template. You can always choose no template as well. WE will do an mvc
                    template.
                    It will then scaffold the project that you want to use. And you are ready to start programming.
                    <div>
                    <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="Pics\vsIDE.PNG"/>
                </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
                <h1 class="card-title">
                    What are the alternatives?
                </h1>
                <div class="card-body">
                    There are many alternatives to Visual Studio. You can use Eclipse, netbeans, codeblocks and many
                    others.
                    These other IDEâ€™s are normally language specific though. You can also use text editors and your
                    terminal.
                    The one I use the most is vs code. This is a lightweight text editor. You need to know more about
                    building
                    projects and using the terminal if you want to use other text editors. T
                    Summary
                    An IDE can make programming faster. It can make it so you don't need to worry about all of the
                    little
                    details. I think it is important to use both an IDE and the terminal. There will be needs for both
                    cases.
