            Moq:
            What is Moqing?
            Moqiing is used to test your code. SOmetimes you don't have access to everything you need to test your code.
            So does this mean you should not test it? No. It just means you need to figure out what you think you would
            get from the things you don't have access to put them into an object and supply this to you code as if it
            came from the source. Sounds simple right. Most of the time it is.

            Why should I Moq:
            You moq so that you now your code is working the way you expect it to be working. At work I have been
            working with an API. I have really struggled to work with this api properly. FOr a long TIme I thought it
            was probably because I wasn't working with the API right or that My code was behaving wrong. So I decided to
            moq what I expected front the API. This helped me to know that the problem was not my code but that the API
            was not allowed requests from My development environment. SHortly after moqing I was able to prove to those
            that I work with that the problem was the API and not my code.
            Downside Of Moq:
            Moqing fixes many testing problems. I think it helps find problems and prove your code. The problem comes
            when you don't know what to moq or what the moq should look like. This can cause you to program incorrectly
            because your assumptions were wrong.
            Summary:
            Just Because it can be wrong doesn't mean you shouldn't moq. It will at least prove that what your working
            on performs as expected.
            Have Fun and Program On.
