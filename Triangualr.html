            This is a game idea that I have. I want it to take the principle of triangularization to find a position. It will be a simple puzzle game. 
            I have created some simple requirements. I am keeping artifacts to the minimum. 
            It is going to be written in Java. 
            I am using swing right now but that may change. 
            It is going to be written following the TDD Ruleset and mindset.
            It will follow OO  programming using encapsulation and interfaces.
