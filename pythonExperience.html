                <p class="card-body">
                    Many consider Python to be the easy language. It is a high level language. It is fast to hack
                    something together and it's eaqsy way to introduce programming to someone new to programing.

                <h2 class="card-title text-center">I think python is an easy language</h2>
                <p class="card-body">In geaneral python is easy to learn. It is easy to get something up and running. I
                    dont know if its what I would suggest to people to learn first as a language.
                    I think it is better to go from a more strict language to the easier language. For me I went from
                    c++ and c to python.
                </p>

                <h2 class="card-title text-center">Why go from harder to easier?</h2>

                <p class="card-body">I think with the eaze of python you dont need to understand what the program is
                    doing. You may also not understand why the computer is behaving the way it is. When you learn the
                    harder language the lower level language you need to understand at a depeer level. You need a
                    greater understanding of what the computer is doing to write in a lower level language. For some
                    thisis the benifit of learning python first though. You can quickly see a project come to life. You
                    can see rapid progress. For those that need to see success early learnign python may be the path to
                    try. </p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2 class="card-title text-center">Struggels I had / have with python</h2>
                <div class="card-body">For me pythons most anoying characteristic is its use of whitespace. For most of
                    the languages I use whitespace does not matter. This is not the case with python. spaces are
                    different from tabs. If you dont indent properly or mix up spaces and tabs the program will not
                    work.
                    With modern text editers this is not as much of a concern but it is the number one thing that slows
                    me down.

                    </h2>
                    <p>To start you need a file ending in .py</p>
                    <p>To make a function start by writing def then give the function name and any arguments that go
                        with it. The you need to type a :. This : tells python that the next part of the program should
                        be the function definition. On the new line make sure you are tabbed in one level. </p>

                    <p> You can make as many functions as you need. The next step is to call the function so that it
                        will run in the program. To do so outside of any function type the function name with () after
                        it.</p>
