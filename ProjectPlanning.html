            <h3 class="title">Why Plan your projects</h3>
            <div class="card bg-secondary">
                <p>One of the hardest parts of a project is keeping the end goal in mind. One of the best ways to stay
                    focused and motivated is to have a well planned project. To keep a project running smoothly I like
                    to use khanban boards, github, and some form of group communication platform like, microsoft teams
                    or slack.</p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="title">Tools</h3>
            <div class="card bg-secondary">
                <p>Currently I am using teams to communicate with my ballot app team.</p>
                <img src="Pics\teams.PNG" />
            </div>
            <div class="card bg-secondary">
                <p>I am using github projects for my khanban board.</p>
                <img src="Pics\khanban.PNG" />
                <p>For my repo I am using <a href="https://github.com/krydge">github.com</a></p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="title">Alternatives to github khanban</h3>
            <div class="card bg-secondary">
                <p class="card-text">This is Gitkraken. For me I think this is the best khanban board I have used. I say
                    this because the tooling is the nicest to use.</p>
                <img src="Pics\Gitkraken.PNG" />
                <p class="card-text">This is Trello. It is another free khanban board. It was my first intro to Khanban
                    boards. I feel that it is a well made program with simple tools. Personaly I like it more than
                    Githubs khanban Board</p>
                <img src="Pics\trello.PNG" />
                <p class="card-text">So if I like these other boards better why did we choose githubs khanban? THe annswer
                    is that it was the easiest to access. It is in a shared location. The most important reason though
                    is this is what the team chose to use. </p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="title">Alternatives to Teams</h3>
            <div class="card bg-secondary">
                <p class="card-text">This is Slack. Personaly I dont care for slack. I never felt all that comfertable using
                    it. Another thing to be consered about is that it will only save the last 1000 messages. </p>
                <img src="Pics\slack.PNG" />
                <p class="card-text">This is Discord. It is another free communications app.It is poppular among people
                    playing games. I have not used it often. </p>
                <img src="Pics\discord.PNG" />
                <p class="card-text">So Why did we choose Microsoft Teams? It again comes down to availability. We all were
                    already using teams to communicate with each other. It allows us to see past conversations. </p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="title">Take aways</h3>
            <div class="card bg-secondary">
                <p class="card-text">There are a few important things to remember when coosing the tools for a project. Ask yourself, Who
                    will be using it, Why will you use it and can everyone use it.
                    Once a choice of tools has been selected as an individual on a team make sure you use them. If you
                    don't you will cause your team more stress and be a less effective member of the team.
